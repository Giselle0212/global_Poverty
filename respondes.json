That said, the buoyant labor market will support private consumption, investment should stay fairly healthy as firms look to boost productive capacity, and the Ukraine war will support the energy sector. Possible new Covid-19 variants, an intensification of the war and tensions with China are risks. FocusEconomics panelists see GDP growing 2.8% in 2022, which is down 0.4 percentage points from the previous month’s forecast. In 2023, our panel sees the economy expanding 2.0%.",
            "economicOutlook": "ond estimate confirmed that the economy contracted in Q1, driven by lower private inventory investment and defense spending, and a negative contribution from net exports. However, the economy’s underlying strength remained intact, with private consumption and fixed investment gaining steam. Turning to Q2, GDP is likely rebounding and is set to grow above 3.0% in quarter-on-quarter SAAR terms, as the contributions from net exports, government spending and inventories improve. Moreover, consumer spending has so far remained robust in the face of elevated price pressures—as shown by brisk retail sales growth in April—thanks to strong employment gains, the fading impact of the pandemic and households running down savings. That said, widespread labor shortages are constraining business activity, and PMI data suggests the manufacturing sector lost some steam at the outset of Q2.",

The economy regained some momentum in May, as the impact of the pandemic ebbed, with retail sales, industrial production, fixed investment and export figures all beating expectations. However, overall activity remained downbeat, with the housing market particularly depressed. Towards the end of Q2, the marked fall in total Covid-19 cases and the recent easing of lockdowns in many areas—including Shanghai—will aid household spending, exports and industrial activity. On the other hand, the threat of further stop-start restrictions will continue to weigh on sentiment, with Beijing and Shanghai resuming mass testing in mid-June in response to the emergence of new Covid-19 clusters.",

            "economicOutlook": "xpected, preliminary data showed the economy contracted in Q1. Record Covid-19 case numbers led the government to introduce quasi-state-of-emergency measures, which along with rising inflation caused private consumption to fall. In Q2, a recovery is under way. Its driving force is private consumption: Most Covid-19 restrictions were scrapped in late March, more than offsetting the drag from higher inflation.  Consumer confidence and the services PMI have risen in the quarter so far. Further reopening will boost private spending even more; some foreign tourists will be permitted entry from June. This said, the external sector appears to be dragging on activity, with export growth and the manufacturing PMI sliding in the quarter so far, due to supply bottlenecks and a slowing global economy due to war in Ukraine, Covid-19 lockdowns in China, and higher global inflation and interest rates.",

FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists project the economy to grow 2.0% in 2022, which is down 0.2 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and to expand 2.5% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "detailed breakdown of Q1 national accounts confirmed the preliminary result of moderate growth, which was mainly driven by fixed investment and inventories. Household spending fell, as higher inflation and deeply pessimistic consumer sentiment more than offset the positive effect of the economic reopening. While the economy is expected to hold up relatively well in Q2, with composite PMI data for April and May showing a continued improvement in operating conditions, other data calls for caution. The war in Ukraine continues to weigh heavily on business and consumer sentiment. Moreover, both harmonized consumer and producer price inflation reached record highs in April, suggesting that price pressures will continue to hamper activity. Meanwhile, the European Commission recently highlighted the investment environment, productivity, digitalization and pensions as areas in need of reform.",

FocusEconomics panelists expect the economy to expand 3.7% in 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 1.5% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "owth was well above the European average in Q1, as the removal of virtually all Covid-19 restrictions supported private consumption. Moreover, fixed investment accelerated from Q4 due to a large expansion in government investment. However, business investment contracted, while exports fell sharply. Moreover, growth only occurred early in the quarter, as monthly data shows GDP flatlined in February and shrank in March, as the cost-of-living squeeze intensified. Moving to Q2, PMI data for April and May suggests a sharp loss of momentum, in line with record inflation, all-time low consumer sentiment and renewed supply chain difficulties. In May, the government announced a GBP 15 billion cost-of-living package, with measures including a discount on energy bills for all households, and fiscal transfers to low earners. The measures will support activity, but potentially at the cost of generating extra inflation.",

The Consensus projects GDP to expand 7.4% in FY 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from the previous month’s forecast, and 6.3% in FY 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "economy recovered above its pre-pandemic level in FY 2021, which ended in March this year. Turning to the first quarter of FY 2022, GDP growth is likely to speed up considerably. Growth in the industrial sector accelerated in April, suggesting it weathered the disruption to power supply caused by record-breaking temperatures well. Moreover, looser Covid-19 restrictions are boosting domestic demand, helping to push the services PMI to an over 11-year high in May. Demand will also be supported by new measures to combat rising inflation, including cuts to fuel duty, a doubling of the fertilizer subsidy, an export ban on wheat and cuts to import tariffs for some raw materials. That said, inflation remained at a near-decade high in May, which together with higher interest rates will be capping momentum.",

Our analysts see the economy expanding 2.9% in 2022, which is down 0.2 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 1.9% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "growth stagnated in quarter-on-quarter terms in Q1 due to a contraction in private spending. Turning to Q2, the war in Ukraine is taking a toll on the economy: Record-high inflation and subdued consumer confidence in April is likely to keep a lid on household consumption. Similarly, business confidence moderated further in May. That said, the composite PMI rose to a four-year high in April and remained upbeat in May, bolstered by the loosening of pandemic-related restrictions. In politics, Emmanuel Macron appointed Élisabeth Borne as the prime minister on 16 May after a cabinet reshuffle. Lastly, in a recent report, the European Commission said that France had successfully managed the pandemic crisis, but had strained public finances as a result. In order to ensure sustainability of public finances, the Commission recommended that France simplifies its pension system.",

Further disruption to Russian gas supplies, as well as rising bond spreads—due to the ECB’s increasing hawkishness—cloud the outlook. FocusEconomics panelists project activity to expand 2.6% in 2022, which is down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month’s projection, and 1.9% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "economy runs a serious risk of falling into a recession in Q2. Italy is one of the non-eastern, Euro area countries most economically vulnerable to the war in Ukraine, due to its large dependence on Russian gas imports. Harmonized inflation remained at record levels in April, while the manufacturing and services PMIs also fell that same month. Likewise, business and consumer confidence deteriorated. Meanwhile, government bond spreads have continued to increase, posing a risk to financial stability given Italy’s large public debt—151% of GDP at the end of last year. That said, government measures seem to be stopping the rot somewhat, with a 15 EUR billion package unveiled in May helping both business and consumer confidence to rebound in that same month. Activity will also be supported by the further relaxation of pandemic-related restrictions, including on tourism, from 1 May.",

Investment was likely restrained by higher interest rates and inflation, and political uncertainty ahead of the October general elections. Turning to Q2, available data suggests the economy continues to expand amid fiscal support and as the impact of the pandemic fades, with the manufacturing and services PMIs averaging higher in April–May relative to Q1, and the unemployment rate falling to a fresh multi-year low in April.

However, momentum picked up in February thanks to healthy expansions in manufacturing and customer-facing services. In particular, the accommodation and food services sector saw a double-digit gain as the Omicron wave faded and associated restrictions were eased. Turning to Q2, available signs are mainly positive. In April, the unemployment rate fell to an all-time low, while the manufacturing PMI was well in expansionary territory and housing starts jumped, boding well for residential investment.

            "economicOutlook": "The economy seemingly moved into a lower gear in Q1. Annual growth in economic activity slowed in the quarter. Moreover, consumer confidence dropped further, while inflation spiked. On top of this, the industrial sector expanded at a weaker pace than in Q4. Turning to Q2, a further deterioration in consumer confidence in April-May, coupled with rising inflation, bodes poorly for household spending and overall activity. Meanwhile, the country recently postponed payments on its over USD 2 billion debt to the Paris Club group until 2024 or until a new framework is agreed. Moreover, the government launched a tender to build a new gas pipeline from the Vaca Muerta shale formation, which could increase transport capacity by 25%, and is encouraging investment in the project. Finally, in order to reduce the fiscal deficit, an 'extraordinary income' tax was announced in June, which should mainly affect the grains industry.",

            "economicOutlook": "Sequential GDP growth softened but beat market projections in the first quarter. Consumer spending slowed considerably due to a normalization of the pace of growth and the spread of the Omicron variant. Meanwhile, exports shrank at a sharper pace amid a less favorable external environment. Activity is seemingly expanding at a healthy pace in Q2. Consumer spending has likely continued to increase, supported by accumulated savings, as suggested by a tight labor market in April and May and retail sales growth in April. That said, plunging consumer sentiment throughout the quarter calls for caution. Moreover, falling business confidence in April and May indicates cooling business investment. Meanwhile, in a bid to address the country’s power crisis and avoid potential blackouts, authorities recently assumed emergency powers to block coal exports.",

FocusEconomics analysts see the economy expanding 2.3% in 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 1.8% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "tput grew at a reduced pace in Q1 2022 compared to Q4 2021, chiefly driven by a contraction in industry. That said, the services and construction sectors expanded at healthy paces and unemployment continued its downward trend. Since March, growth is likely sluggish, affected by the global slowdown in demand and high inflation. Industrial production is likely being affected by the sector’s elevated dependency on Russian gas, high prices for which will squeeze firms’ profit margins. Moreover, consumer confidence remained severely downbeat in April and May, likely weakening consumption in the quarter. That said, business confidence held up through May, which could be supporting investment intentions. Finally, in a May report the European Commission recommended that Belgium focus on addressing fiscal sustainability challenges, excessive red tape and the low participation rate.",

            "economicOutlook": "put growth was likely resilient in the first quarter of this year. The services sector benefited from an improving labor market and reduced Covid restrictions while industrial output grew at the fastest pace in 16 months in March. That said, the manufacturing PMI dipped to an 11-month low in March, as the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war hit sentiment. Moreover, consumer confidence worsened during the quarter amid soaring prices, which could have limited private consumption. In Q2, the economy is likely losing steam. In April, consumer confidence continued to worsen and inflation rose to the highest level in 27 years, which is likely tempering private spending. However, the manufacturing PMI improved slightly in April. Meanwhile, in early May, Greece removed virtually all remaining Covid-19 restrictions, which should help spur the tourism industry heading into the summer season.",

That said, concerns over rising inflation and political uncertainty weigh on the outlook. FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists expect GDP to expand 5.1% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month’s forecast. GDP is seen growing 5.0% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "On the heels of a stable year-on-year GDP growth figure in Q1, the economy appears to be losing momentum in the second quarter. Domestically, private spending likely weakened: Retail sales slowed to an eight-month low in May amid a broad-based deterioration, while inflation rose to its highest level in over three years. Moreover, persistent supply constraints led the manufacturing PMI to moderate notably in May. Similarly, although the external sector likely benefitted from surging commodity prices, merchandise exports growth cooled remarkably in May. The slowdown came after the country implemented a controversial ban on palm oil exports in May, which it quickly reversed after three weeks amid widespread criticism. In response, President Joko Widodo dismissed the trade minister and reshuffled his cabinet on 15 June. Nonetheless, the policy reversal stands to rally exports ahead.",

Most Covid-19 restrictions were scrapped in January, boosting spending and easing disruptions to labor supply. Retail sales growth plus the manufacturing and services PMIs averaged higher in Q1 than in Q4. That said, rising energy price pressures will have hurt consumer spending and the external balance; import growth averaged higher in Q1 relative to Q4, and consumer confidence was down sharply in March. Some support to growth will have come from the government’s EUR 505 million relief package in February and a fuel excise cut in March. Heading into Q2, activity is likely to weaken. Harmonized inflation reached record highs in April, while consumer confidence continued to slip in April–May. Additionally, supply bottlenecks and weakening foreign demand pushed the manufacturing PMI down in April.",

That said, the services sector is likely supporting activity given falling unemployment and that most Covid-19 restrictions were removed in April; consumer confidence and retail sales held up well that month despite rising inflation. The USD 49.5 billion supplementary budget passed in May will further support activity.",

More positively, higher oil prices will aid government coffers. Disruptions to manufacturing supply chains and a potential hard economic landing in the U.S. are risks. FocusEconomics panelists project the economy to expand 1.9% in 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast. In 2023, they see GDP growth of 2.1%.",
            "economicOutlook": "vised figures show that the economy expanded 1.0% quarter on quarter in Q1, marginally faster than previously estimated. The reading was driven by a sharp rebound in services activity, likely as the impact of last year’s labor outsourcing ban faded. Industrial output also picked up pace amid increased vehicle production and strong U.S. import demand, while the agricultural sector shrank. In Q2, available data suggests a continued—albeit milder—expansion, as higher inflation and interest rates weigh on activity. Experimental data from the statistics office pointed to a slowdown in economic growth in April due to softer services momentum. Moreover, both the manufacturing and services PMIs declined somewhat in May. However, strong employment and wage growth in the U.S. continues to spur remittances inflows, which should be buttressing consumption.",

            "economicOutlook": "The Dutch economy made a hesitant start to the year, with growth evaporating on the back of falling household consumption and moderating investment growth. During the second quarter, the data points to a two-speed economy. On one hand, business confidence rose to its highest level since November 2021 in April, while the manufacturing PMI showed that operating conditions continued to improve during the month. On the other hand, consumer sentiment deteriorated significantly during April and May, with inflation remaining in double digits during April. This is likely to constrain household spending during the quarter, despite a further tightening of the labor market in April. Meanwhile, the European Commission recently listed tax distortions, the housing market, the pension system and the green-energy transition as key issues for the government to address.",

Power supply issues will further jeopardize activity. Moreover, social rifts and violence ahead of the February 2023 elections could undermine momentum. The government’s investment push should support activity, however. FocusEconomics panelists see GDP growth coming in at 3.0% in 2022, which is up 0.2 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 3.0% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "conomic growth cooled in the first quarter of the year due to a further deterioration in the key oil sector. This more than offset a strong performance in the services sector leading non-oil sector activity to firm. Second-quarter data paints a mixed picture. Private-sector operating conditions improved at a fractionally slower pace in April–May, while credit growth was also broadly stable in April. That said, inflation rose markedly in the same month. A pickup in core inflation highlights that price pressures are farther-reaching than energy and food price increases. Meanwhile, sectarian violence spread to the country’s relatively safe south-western region. Social tensions and violence could increase going forward, as religious and regional divides are heightening the stakes of the February 2023 presidential elections.",

FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists estimate total GDP to grow 3.5% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month’s forecast, and to expand 2.3% in 2023. Our panel sees mainland GDP increasing 3.6% in 2022, which is down 0.2 percentage points from last month’s projection, and growing 2.1% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "Q1 2022, the economy contracted in sequential terms at the sharpest rate since the outbreak of the pandemic. Restrictions put in place in January to contain the spread of the Omicron variant hurt economic activity, which then picked up slightly in February and March after their removal. The GDP growth downturn in the quarter was broad-based, with private and public spending declining, and the external sector continuing to weigh on the reading. In Q2, activity should rebound. The manufacturing PMI showed that conditions improved at the strongest pace in five months in April. Additionally, government finances will be benefitting from high oil prices, boding well for a large fiscal surplus. That said, household spending could be in a tough spot, as price pressures hit an over 13-year high in April, likely capping consumption.",

A marked accumulation of stocks shielded against supply side disruptions and drove the acceleration. Strong, albeit softer, private consumption growth amid a healthy labor market further supported activity. The pace of economic growth should moderate in Q2, partially due to a waning low base effect. Industrial activity cooled in April, likely weighed down by supply chain constraints, while inflation continued to soar. Business sentiment remained subdued in April and May, while the PMI moved into contractionary terrain in May. That said, retail sales skyrocketed in April. Meanwhile, the government terminated its agreement with Russia to receive gas, while parliament approved a judicial reform to meet EU demands, paving the way to receive EU recovery funds.",

However, the prolongation of supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine pose downside risks. FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists see GDP growing 5.3% in 2022, which is up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month’s forecast. For 2023, the panel sees GDP climbing 2.3%.",
            "economicOutlook": "fter Q1’s surprisingly positive GDP figures, growth appears to be normalizing in Q2. In April, consumer sentiment remained quite downbeat due to the war in Ukraine, while inflation continued to spike, which is likely to weigh on consumer spending. On the other hand, business confidence ticked up in April, while the tourism sector performed robustly during the same month. The stronger-than-expected recovery, coupled with a degree of public spending restraint, led Fitch Ratings to revise the country’s outlook from stable to positive in early May, while the finance minister vowed to reduce the public debt at a faster pace to help ensure financial stability. The European Commission recently drew attention to upward pressure on public spending stemming from the country’s sizeable public sector wage bill, while the IMF has called for measures to bolster pension sustainability.",

Turning to Q2, the economy is heading into a deep recession as Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine’s Donbas region drags on and sanctions bite. Economic activity contracted in April, seemingly driven by a plunge in private spending as retail sales tumbled. Similarly, investment activity should be feeling the impact of sanctions and capital outflows. Meanwhile, although soaring energy prices have helped the external sector hold up relatively well so far, the EU’s decision in late May to largely ban Russian oil imports by end-2022 will hit the sector hard in the coming months. Meanwhile, to prop up the ailing economy, the government announced double digit hikes to pensions and the minimum wage, and slashed interest rate again in May. However, this will be insufficient to prevent a recession.",

On 2 June, OPEC+ agreed to ramp up oil production quota increases in July and August by 50.0%, further improving the outlook. Risks to the outlook include rising global inflation and interest rates. FocusEconomics panelists see GDP growing 7.4% in 2022, which is up 0.2 percentage points from last month’s forecast. In 2023, the panel sees economic growth at 3.6%.",
            "economicOutlook": "After expanding at the fastest pace in more than a decade during Q1, the economy is likely to remain at full throttle in Q2. Thanks to an increased OPEC+ quota, oil production rose to its highest level in two years during April. After slipping during that same month, oil prices then recorded their highest monthly average since 2011 in May. Rising oil prices are boosting the external and fiscal balances. However, this windfall is unlikely to boost GDP as much as in recent years. The government is concerned that as the world turns away from fossil fuels, this could be oil’s last great bull run. As a result, it is planning to plough money from this windfall into the country’s USD 600 billion sovereign wealth fund as part of its effort to diversify the economy. It will also use some of it to rebuild foreign exchange reserves and reduce public debt.",

Rising interest rates and a weak fiscal position cloud the outlook.

            "economicOutlook": "th weakened in the first quarter, as household spending was weighed down by surging inflation and the spread of the Omicron variant. Turning to Q2, in April, a robust recovery in tourism likely underpinned the tertiary sector, as signaled by a higher services PMI reading, while the rate of unemployment fell and retail sales rebounded strongly. However, elevated inflation, downbeat consumer confidence and a softer expansion in manufacturing activity call for caution. Meanwhile, the European Commission recently warned of imbalances in the public accounts, with the independent fiscal authority lamenting the absence of a medium-term strategy to bring them under control. Furthermore, the Bank of Spain has called for additional reforms to ensure the sustainability of the public pensions system.",

Underlying momentum slowed in Q1, as mounting price pressures and uncertainty weighed on consumer sentiment, and on spending in turn. Available data points to a brighter picture in the second quarter. In April, the unemployment rate remained at the joint-lowest level since March 2020, which should have supported private spending as the highest inflation rates in over three decades weighed on consumers. Further, both business confidence and economic sentiment were upbeat in the same month. Additionally, both the manufacturing and services PMIs revealed that conditions continued to improve at robust paces in April. On 18 May, Swedish and Finnish authorities submitted official applications to join NATO, abandoning long traditions of neutrality. Turkey could block their bids, however.",

            "economicOutlook": "In Q1, the economy likely recorded a mild expansion that was broadly in line with the European average. The lifting of virtually all Covid-19 restrictions from mid-February should have aided domestic demand, offsetting a more adverse external panorama following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Looking at available indicators, the manufacturing PMI averaged slightly lower in Q1 than in Q4 and the KOF Barometer declined through March. In contrast, the services PMI averaged higher in Q1 as the impact of the pandemic faded. Turning to Q2, in April both the manufacturing and services PMIs fell to their lowest levels since early 2021. However, they continued to point to robust growth in the economy. Moreover, while inflation has picked up it remains the lowest in Western Europe, which should be supporting consumer spending.",

            "economicOutlook": "ter growth moderated in Q1, underlying momentum is easing in Q2. Pandemic-related restrictions in China and generally less favorable global demand conditions are weighing on the external sector and manufacturing. In May, the manufacturing PMI tumbled to a near two-year low and export growth waned, while export orders fell in April. Moreover, the non-manufacturing index plunged into contractionary territory in May, as record Covid-19 cases led to greater caution among consumers and firms. However, the government’s pivot towards living with the virus will limit the fallout. Despite surging caseloads, travel restrictions are being progressively eased, with the quarantine time for visitors cut to three days in June. In other news, Taiwan and the U.S. recently launched a trade “initiative”, signaling warming ties with Washington. However, the shift falls far short of a comprehensive trade deal.",

FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists project the economy to expand 2.9% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month, and 3.3% in 2023.",
            "economicOutlook": "st-quarter economic growth lost some steam due to softer expansions in household consumption, amid red-hot inflation and deeply pessimistic sentiment. Economic growth is set to moderate further in the second quarter amid the fallout from the war in Ukraine, even-higher inflation and a weakened currency. Consumer sentiment deteriorated in April–May against the backdrop of greater price pressures, which are eroding wage growth and eating into consumers’ pockets. The manufacturing PMI moved further into contractionary territory in the same two months due to protracted supply chain issues and exchange-rate weakness. More positively, business confidence rose in the same period on robust expectations. Meanwhile, President Erdogan vetoed Sweden and Finland’s late March requests to join NATO and seems intent on further delaying or preventing their accessions into the alliance.",
